					<h1 class="text-center">Cellular Respiration</h1>
					<div>
						Cellular Respiration happens in MITOCHONDRIA.It release chemical energy stored in <strong>glucose</strong>, and release them as smaller molecules called <strong>ATP</strong>.
					</div>
					<div>
                    	<br>
						<h2>Aerobic or Anaerobic?</h2>
						<div>
							Aerobic, because it uses its gill to breath air, and using air help it to release more ATP, although it takes a longer and more complex process. It starts in cytoplasm, and end in mitochondria.
						</div>
						<div class="hidden-xs">

						<div><strong>ATP</strong>:Adenosine Triphosphate</div>
						<div><strong>ADP</strong>:Adenosine Diphosphate</div>
						<div>
							Contains less energy tha glucose, use as short term energy source And when the last phosphate of ATP is removed, the energy will power up the ocean wolf.

					<h1 class="text-center">Homostasis</h1>
					<div>
						It need to live in the ocean to maintain homostasis, and transport substances in and out of the body.

					<h2>Passive Transport -- Don't Require Energy</h2>
                    <br>
					<h3>Osmosis</h3>
					<div>
						Occurs because of the polarity of water, they can move through the membrane eaisly most of the times by interacting with other polar molecules. It move from hypertonic solution to hypotonic solutoin. It move constantly in the isotonic solution. That means when Ocean wolves swim into the river or spring, the salt in the water decreases, their body become hypertonic, and the water will flow in their body, they became too big , and finally <strong>lyse</strong>(die) from that. If there is too much salt, they will shrink, because all the water in their body will move out of their body.
					</div>
                    <br>
					<h3>Diffusion</h3>
					<div>
						After breathing the air through the gill, the gas exchange happend as diffusion. Diffusion is the process which molecules move randomly from area of higher concentration to lower concentration.
					</div>
                    <br>
					<h3>Facilitated Diffusion</h3>
					<div>
						Using special carrier protein with a central channel to select which kind of molecules to move across the membrane from higher concentratoin to lower concentration. Most of the time, glucose arre transported using this way.
					</div>
                    <br>
					<h2>Active Transport -- Need Energy</h2>
					<div>
						When energy (<strong>ATP</strong>) is required. Occurs when molecules are too big or moving against concentration gradient with th help from protein. The action that take in and out the cell are called <strong>Endocytosis</strong> and <strong>Exocytosis</strong>. All the substances that enters the cell are stored inside <strong>vesicle</strong>. Ocean wolf use active transport to absorb glucose.
